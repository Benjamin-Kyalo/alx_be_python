# Task Description:

# Create a Python script that asks the user for their current age and then calculates how old they will be in a specific future year. This task introduces handling user input and reinforces arithmetic operations.

# Ask for the userâ€™s current age
current_age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# We know 2050 is 27 years after 2023
future_age = current_age + 27

# Show the result
print(f"In 2050, you will be {future_age} years old.")
