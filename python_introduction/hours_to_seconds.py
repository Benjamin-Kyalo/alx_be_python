# Task Description:

# For this task, write a Python script that converts a specific number of hours into seconds. This task reinforces the concept of arithmetic operations within a practical context.

# Declaring the number of hours
hours = 2
# Converting hours to seconds
seconds = hours * 3600
print("2 hours(s) is", seconds)  
# This script declares a variable for hours, converts it to seconds by multiplying by 3600, and prints the result.
